In 13 minutes, prof. Andrew Ng (he has many courses on AI) demonstrates on slides advanced methods for using large language models to improve the software development process.

The main ideas of the speech:

🧠 Agent approaches in AI are becoming increasingly popular and effective. This is an **iterative**  process where AI can learn, review, and improve its result.

✍️ **Reflection**: An AI agent can evaluate its own code/result and refine it. This increases productivity.

🤖 Multi-agent systems: using **two or more agents**, such as an expert coder and an expert reviewer, significantly improves the quality.

🔧 Using **tools**: connecting AI to various tools (web search, data analysis, etc.) expands its capabilities.

👷‍♂️ **Planning**: AI agents can autonomously plan actions and change the plan in case of failures, which is impressive.

🔀 **Combination**  of all these approaches opens up new possibilities and improves AI results compared to simple code generation (there is a slide with a graph, but with a 40% axis).

_That is, agent-based artificial intelligence technologies may be the next step in the field of software development._
