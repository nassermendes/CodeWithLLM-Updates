Instead of paying for individual **API keys** for every AI service, there are cost-effective and flexible alternatives. One option is to use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), which acts as a unified API for various models. This can potentially consolidate costs and simplify integration.

If you have powerful hardware and prioritize privacy or want more control, you can run large language models (LLMs) locally. Tools like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) make it easier to deploy and manage these models on your own machine. For code autocompletion specifically, consider local-first solutions like [TabbyML](https://www.tabbyml.com/).
