Cursor's journey began by essentially cloning GitHub Copilot's in-editor code completion. They initially called it **Copilot++** and steadily improved it, focusing on its ability to understand multiple lines of code.

By mid-2024, the feature was rebranded as **Cursor Tab** (a nod to its activation method by Tab button ðŸ˜‰) â€” reflecting gains in speed and accuracy. And just a month ago, they [announced a new model](https://www.cursor.com/blog/tab-update) called **Fusion**, which improves support for large files.

*Now, competitors are scrambling to catch up.*

Starting February 13th, **Zed** announced in beta [Edit Prediction](https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction) based on the open-source Zeta model.

And **Windsurf** [announced Wave 3](https://codeium.com/blog/windsurf-wave-3), in addition to supporting MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)), also improved their autocomplete model in the editor, calling it *Tab-to-jump*.

And **GitHub Copilot** itself doesn't want to be left behind. Currently, the "*Next Edit Suggestion*" feature is in preview â€” it needs to be activated in the settings ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbUnwaSllTY)).
