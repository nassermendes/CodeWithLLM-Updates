 **Goose**1.0.4

Project Goose - an open-source artificial intelligence agent. Offers both a desktop interface and a command-line interface (CLI). It uses [extensions](https://block.github.io/goose/v1/extensions/)to connect to existing tools and applications, such as GitHub or JetBrains development environment, thanks to [MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/mcp). The catalog is still very minimalist.

Goose is multifunctional, supporting various LLM providers and capable of handling a wide range of engineering tasks, including 
_code migration, project onboarding with programming languages, code refactoring, performance evaluation, code coverage improvement, API framework creation, and modular test generation._. 

Although it was initially focused on engineering, its open nature encourages the community to explore various applications.

Fortunately, not in Python, but in Rust. It supports macOS and Linux. In Windows, only through WSL ( [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)).
