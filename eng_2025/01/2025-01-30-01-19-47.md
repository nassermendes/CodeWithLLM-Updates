plugin is actively changing from just an automatic code editor to the orchestration of various agents with their prompts and limitations.

**Roo Code Update**  (prev. Roo Cline) v 3.3

Code Actions

Roo Code now integrates directly with the native VS Code Code Actions system, providing quick fixes and refactoring options right in the editor. Look for a light bulb above the code 💡

Advanced mode capabilities

    Markdown Editing: implemented one of the most requested features - "Ask" and "Architect" modes can now create and edit Markdown files!

    Custom File Restrictions: in general, custom modes can now be limited to certain file patterns (can only edit Markdown files).

    **Self-switching mode**: modes can intelligently request switching between each other depending on the task. For example, the "Code" mode may request switching to the "Test Engineer" mode when it is ready to write tests.
