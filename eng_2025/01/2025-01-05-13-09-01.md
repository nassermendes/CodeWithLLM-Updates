**Aider LLM Leaderboards** [https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/) 

Polyglot test measures the ability of LLMs to program in popular languages.

Aider works best with LLMs that are good at _editing_  code, not just generating code well. To evaluate the editing skills of LLMs, Aider uses tests that assess the model's ability to consistently follow system prompts to successfully edit code.
