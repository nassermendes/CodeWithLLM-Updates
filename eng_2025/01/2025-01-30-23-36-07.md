**Cursor** 

DeepSeek models: _DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek v3 are supported in versions 0.45 and 0.44. You can enable them in Settings > Models. We host these models in the USA._ 

But the composer (automatic code writing system) still supports only outdated GPT-4o or Claude-3.5 for now. In the chat with r1, the <think> tag is not a hidden block.
