The code analyzer, analyzing linearly, often got stuck in details. To improve the analysis, we changed the approach, modeling the Mindset of experienced developers:

**üìù File grouping**: files are grouped by functionality (e.g., "authentication", "database").

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Context**: a description of the group's functionality within the overall architecture is added before code analysis. Impact analysis: consider changes in relation to the **entire**  system

üï∞ Historical understanding: track why the code evolved in a certain way

prompt to the group

    Analyzing authentication system files:
    - Core token validation logic
    - Session management
    - Related middleware
    
    Focus on:
    1. How these integrate with existing auth patterns
    2. Security implications
    3. Performance impact on other systems

    Files to analyze:
    ${formatFiles(group.files)}


The result was an improvement in the quality of understanding, from simple observations to identifying potential problems, such as conflicts and relationships between components.
